# Web App - Reddit Collage

This app gathers image data from reddit.com and displays them in a collage-like format.

The app uses flexbox to order most of the data.
The header has nested flexboxes so the text input can auto-adjust to the users screen size.

All the images are passed a set width that is calculated at runtime and whenever the screen resizes.
